RPyGeo 1.0.0 has been released on 14.11.2018 on CRAN. 
The _RPyGeo_ package establishes an interface to the geoprocessing tools of _ArcGIS_ from within R. 
[ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview) is one of the leading commercial GIS applications and is being developed by Esri since 1999.

ArcGIS offers access to its geoprocessing tools via a Python site-package called _ArcPy_. 
The new version of _RPyGeo_ reads the site-package via the [reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/index.html) package into the R session.

If you want to run the following examples you need a working ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro installation. In addition, install and attach the following packages and execute the other commands to get some data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("RPyGeo")
library("sf")
library("raster")
library("magrittr")

data(dem, package = "RQGIS")
writeRaster(dem, file.path(tempdir(), "dem.tif"), format = "GTiff")
```

After a quick initialization, which usually finds the ArcGIS installation automatically, all geoprocessing tools of ArcGIS are available in R.   

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arcpy <- rpygeo_build_env(workspace = tempdir(),
                          overwrite = TRUE)
```

The ArcPy functions can be accessed via the `$` operator. All functions are listed after typing the `$` operator in RStudio. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arcpy$Slope_3d(in_raster = "dem.tif", out_raster = "slope.tif")
```

RPyGeo can load spatial objects stored in Esri's proprietary geodatabases as well as files from the hard disk with the `rpygeo_load()` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
slope <- rpygeo_load("slope.tif")

plot(slope)
```

Both functions can be chained using the pipe operator. It is also possible to use the pipe operator to chain multiple geoprocessing tools.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arcpy$Slope_3d(in_raster = "dem.tif", out_raster = "slope.tif") %>%
  rpygeo_load()
```

Map algebra expressions can be used in RPyGeo with special operators to modify ArcPy raster objects. The resulting temporary files can be saved to the hard disk with the helper function `rpygeo_save()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ras <- arcpy$sa$Raster("dem.tif") 

ras %rpygeo_+% 2 %>%
  rpygeo_save("dem_2.tif")
```

With the new version many other utility functions are added. Help files for all AcrPy functions can be viewed directly inside Rstudio with the `rpygeo_help()` function. `rpygeo_search()` returns all available geoprocessing functions that contain a specified search term. The new functions try to provide a seamless workflow between ArcGIS and R.

In 2015 Esri released the [R-ArcGIS Bridge](https://r-arcgis.github.io), a software that also connects ArcGIS and R. Essentially, the R-ArcGIS Bridge offers read, write and conversion functions to transfer data from ArcGIS to R and vice versa. The idea is to use the large number of R packages to solve spatial problems, which cannot be solved with ArcGIS alone. R scripts are integrated into geoprocessing scripts, which can be run as geoprocessing tools from within ArcGIS. The user can add a user interface to the geoprocessing tool or use it as a part of a ModelBuilder workflow. However, no functionality is added for the R user. The R-ArcGIS Bridge cannot run geoprocessing tools from within R, whereas RPyGeo offers almost all geoprocessing tools of ArcGIS directly from the R session. The R-ArcGIS Bridge is developed for users, who want to process their whole workflow from within ArcGIS, whereas RPyGeo is developed for R users who wants to integrate a geoprocessing tool into their R workflow.

For a detailed instruction on how to use RPyGeo we would like to refer to the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPyGeo/RPyGeo.pdf). It includes a tutorial with all essential RPyGeo functions and the necessary data to run the above examples.

The source code of RpyGeo is now hosted on Github within the r-spatial organization. If you find any bugs please report them at our new development repository [r-spatial/RPyGeo](https://github.com/r-spatial/RPyGeo) or help us fix them via a pull request.

Summary
-------

This is the first blog on the
[stars](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars) project, an R-Consortium
funded project for *spatiotemporal tidy arrays with R*. It shows how
`stars` combines bands and/or subdatasets of GDAL datasets (data cubes)
into R arrays with well-referenced space and time dimensions, how it
deals with affine (rotated) grids, and how it interfaces to packages
`dplyr`, `sf` and `raster`. An artificial example shows the creation of
an origin-destination matrix by travel mode and time.

Introduction
------------

The goals of the stars project are

-   to handle raster data in a way that integrates well with the
    [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) project and with the
    [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
-   to handle array data (time series, or otherwise functional data)
    where time and space are among the dimensions
-   to do this in a scalable way, i.e. deal with cases where data are
    too large to fit in memory or on disk
-   to think about a migration path for the large and famous
    [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/package=raster) in the same
    directions

In its current stage `stars` and (as planned) does not have

-   scalability to large data sets; everything is still in memory
-   writing data back to disk

The package is loaded by

    # devtools::install_github("r-spatial/stars")
    library(stars)
    ## Loading required package: dplyr
    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag
    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    ## Loading required package: magrittr
    ## Loading required package: sf
    ## Loading required package: methods
    ## Linking to GEOS 3.5.1, GDAL 2.1.2, proj.4 4.9.3
    ## Linking to GDAL 2.1.2

The `stars` package links natively to GDAL; all I/O is done through
direct calls to GDAL functions, without using `sf` or `rgdal`.
Spatiotemporal arrays are stored in objects of class `stars`, and
methods for class `stars` currently include:

    methods(class = "stars")
    ##  [1] aperm         as.data.frame as.tbl_cube   c             coerce       
    ##  [6] dim           filter        image         initialize    mutate       
    ## [11] print         pull          select        show          slotsFromS3  
    ## [16] st_as_sf      st_as_sfc     st_bbox       st_crs        st_dimensions
    ## see '?methods' for accessing help and source code

Note that *everything* in the `stars` api may still be subject to change
in the next few months.

Reading a satellite image
-------------------------

We can read a satellite image through GDAL, e.g. from a GeoTIFF file in
the package:

    tif = system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars")
    x <- tif %>% st_stars 
    par(mar = rep(0,4))
    image(x, col = grey((4:10)/10))

![](/images/stars1-1-1.png)

From the following output, we can see that the image is geographically
referenced, and that the object returned (`x`) has three dimensions:
`x`, `y` and `band`, and one attribute:

    x
    ## stars object with 3 dimensions and 1 attribute
    ## attribute(s), of first 1e+05 cells:
    ##  /home/edzer/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/stars/tif/L7_ETMs.tif 
    ##  Min.   : 47.00                                                      
    ##  1st Qu.: 65.00                                                      
    ##  Median : 76.00                                                      
    ##  Mean   : 77.34                                                      
    ##  3rd Qu.: 87.00                                                      
    ##  Max.   :255.00                                                      
    ## dimension(s):
    ##      from  to  offset delta
    ## x       1 349  288776  28.5
    ## y       1 352 9120761 -28.5
    ## band    1   6      NA    NA
    ##                                                                                refsys
    ## x    +proj=utm +zone=25 +south +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs 
    ## y    +proj=utm +zone=25 +south +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs 
    ## band                                                                               NA
    ##      point values
    ## x    FALSE   NULL
    ## y    FALSE   NULL
    ## band    NA   NULL

Each dimension has a name; the meaning of the fields of a single
dimension are:

| *field* | *meaning*                                                    |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| from    | the origin index (1)                                         |
| to      | the final index (dim(x)\[i\])                                |
| offset  | the start value for this dimension                           |
| delta   | the step size for this dimension                             |
| refsys  | the reference system, or proj4string                         |
| point   | logical; whether cells refer to points, or intervals         |
| values  | the sequence of values for this dimension (e.g., geometries) |

This means that for an index i (starting at \\(i=1\\)) along a certain
dimension, the corresponding dimension value (coordinate, time) is
\\(\mbox{offset} + (i-1) \times \mbox{delta}\\). This value then refers
to the start (edge) of the cell or interval; in order to get the
interval middle or cell centre, one needs to add half an offset.

Dimension `band` is a simple sequence from 1 to 6. Although bands refer
to colors, their wavelength (color) values are not available.

For this particular dataset (and most other raster datasets), we see
that offset for dimension `y` is negative: this means that consecutive
array values have decreasing \\(y\\) values: cells are ordered from top
to bottom, opposite the direction of the \\(y\\) axis.

`st_stars` reads all bands from a raster dataset, or a set of raster
datasets, into a single `stars` array structure. While doing so, raster
values (often UINT8 or UINT16) are converted to double (numeric) values,
and scaled back to their original values if needed.

The data structure `stars` resembles the `tbl_cube` found in `dplyr`; we
can convert to that by

    as.tbl_cube(x)
    ## Source: local array [737,088 x 3]
    ## D: x [dbl, 349]
    ## D: y [dbl, 352]
    ## D: band [int, 6]
    ## M: /home/edzer/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/stars/tif/L7_ETMs.tif [dbl]

In contrast to `stars` objects, `tbl_cube` objects

-   do not explicitly handle *regular* dimensions (offset, delta)
-   do not register reference systems (unless they are a single
    dimension property)
-   do not cope with affine grids (see below)
-   do not cope with dimensions represented by a list (e.g. simple
    features, see below)
-   do not register whether attribute values (measurements) refer to
    point or interval values, on each dimension

Affine grids
------------

The GDAL model can deal also with spatial rasters that are regular but
not aligned with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): affine grids. An example is given
here:

    par(cex.axis = .7) # font size axis tic labels 
    geomatrix = system.file("tif/geomatrix.tif", package = "stars")
    geomatrix %>% st_stars %>% st_as_sf(as_points = FALSE) %>%
      plot(axes =TRUE, main = "geomatrix.tif", graticule = TRUE)

![](/images/stars1-2-1.png)

Looking at the dimensions

    geomatrix %>% st_stars %>% st_dimensions
    ##   from to  offset delta                        geotransform
    ## x    1 20 1841002   1.5 1841000, 1.5, -5, 1144000, -5, -1.5
    ## y    1 20 1144003  -1.5 1841000, 1.5, -5, 1144000, -5, -1.5
    ##                                               refsys point values
    ## x +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs   TRUE   NULL
    ## y +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs   TRUE   NULL

further reveals that we now have a `geotransform` field shown in the
dimension table; this is only displayed when the affine parameters are
non-zero. The geotransform field has six parameters, \\(gt_1,...,gt_6\\)
that are used to transform internal raster coordinates (column pixel
\\(i\\) and row pixel \\(j\\)) to world coordinates (\\(x\\), \\(y\\)):

\\[x = gt_1 + (i-1) gt_2 + (j-1) gt_3\\]

\\[y = gt_4 + (i-1) gt_5 + (j-1) gt_6\\]

When \\(gt_3\\) and \\(gt_5\\) are zero, the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are
parallel to \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), which makes it appear unrotated.

Reading a raster time series: netcdf
------------------------------------

Another example is when we read raster time series model outputs in a
NetCDF file, e.g. by

    prec = st_stars("data/full_data_daily_2013.nc")
    ## p, sd, ek, s,

(Note that this 380 Mb file is not included; data are described
[here](ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/fulldata-daily_v1_doi_download.html),
and were downloaded from
[here](ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/full_data_daily_V1/full_data_daily_2013.nc.gz)).

We see that

    prec
    ## stars object with 3 dimensions and 4 attributes
    ## attribute(s), of first 1e+05 cells:
    ##   p [(mm/day)]    sd [(mm/day)]       ek [%]       s [gauges per gridcell]
    ##  Min.   :  0.00   Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :  1.02   Min.   :-99999         
    ##  1st Qu.:  0.00   1st Qu.: 0.00   1st Qu.: 15.38   1st Qu.:-99999         
    ##  Median :  0.10   Median : 0.16   Median : 24.70   Median :-99999         
    ##  Mean   :  1.71   Mean   : 1.74   Mean   : 29.72   Mean   :-65915         
    ##  3rd Qu.:  0.97   3rd Qu.: 1.14   3rd Qu.: 40.20   3rd Qu.:     0         
    ##  Max.   :133.53   Max.   :73.51   Max.   :100.00   Max.   :   101         
    ##  NA's   :66000    NA's   :66000   NA's   :66000                           
    ## dimension(s):
    ##      from  to     offset  delta  refsys point values
    ## x       1 360       -180      1      NA    NA   NULL
    ## y       1 180         90     -1      NA    NA   NULL
    ## time    1 365 2013-01-01 1 days POSIXct    NA   NULL

For this dataset we can see that

-   variables have units associated
-   time is now a dimension, with proper units and time steps
-   missing values for the fourth variable were not taken care off
    correctly

### Reading datasets from multiple files

Model data are often spread across many files. An example of a 0.25
degree grid, global daily sea surface temperature product is found
[here](ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/OI-daily-v2/NetCDF/); a subset of
the 1981 data was downloaded from
[here](ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/OI-daily-v2/NetCDF/1981/AVHRR/).

We read the data by giving `st_stars` a vector with character names:

    x = c(
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810901.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810902.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810903.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810904.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810905.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810906.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810907.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810908.nc",
    "avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.19810909.nc"
    )

    (y = st_stars(x, quiet = TRUE))
    ## stars object with 4 dimensions and 4 attributes
    ## attribute(s), of first 1e+05 cells:
    ##  sst [degrees C] anom [degrees C] err [degrees C] ice [percentage]
    ##  Min.   :-1.80   Min.   :-4.69    Min.   :0.110   Min.   :0.010   
    ##  1st Qu.:-1.19   1st Qu.:-0.06    1st Qu.:0.300   1st Qu.:0.730   
    ##  Median :-1.05   Median : 0.52    Median :0.300   Median :0.830   
    ##  Mean   :-0.32   Mean   : 0.23    Mean   :0.295   Mean   :0.766   
    ##  3rd Qu.:-0.20   3rd Qu.: 0.71    3rd Qu.:0.300   3rd Qu.:0.870   
    ##  Max.   : 9.36   Max.   : 3.70    Max.   :0.480   Max.   :1.000   
    ##  NA's   :13360   NA's   :13360    NA's   :13360   NA's   :27377   
    ## dimension(s):
    ##      from   to     offset  delta  refsys point values
    ## x       1 1440          0   0.25      NA    NA   NULL
    ## y       1  720         90  -0.25      NA    NA   NULL
    ## time    1    9 1981-09-01 1 days POSIXct    NA   NULL
    ## zlev    1    1   0 meters     NA      NA    NA   NULL

Next, we select sea surface temperature (`sst`), and drop the singular
`zlev` (depth) dimension using `adrop`:

    library(abind)
    z <- y %>% select(sst) %>% adrop

We can now graph the sea surface temperature (SST) using `ggplot`, which
needs data in a long table form, and without units:

    df = as.data.frame(z)
    df$sst = unclass(df$sst)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(viridis)
    ## Loading required package: viridisLite
    library(ggthemes)
    ggplot() +  
      geom_tile(data=df, aes(x=x, y=y, fill=sst), alpha=0.8) + 
      facet_wrap("time") +
      scale_fill_viridis() +
      coord_equal() +
      theme_map() +
      theme(legend.position="bottom") +
      theme(legend.key.width=unit(2, "cm"))

More complex arrays
-------------------

Like `tbl_cube`, `stars` arrays have no limits to the number of
dimensions they handle. An example is the origin-destination (OD)
matrix, by time and travel mode.

### OD: space x space x travel mode x time x time

We create a 5-dimensional matrix of traffic between regions, by day, by
time of day, and by travel mode. Having day and time of day each as
dimension is an advantage when we want to compute patters over the day,
for a certain period.

    nc = read_sf(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf")) 
    to = from = st_geometry(nc) # 100 polygons: O and D regions
    mode = c("car", "bike", "foot") # travel mode
    day = 1:100 # arbitrary
    library(units)
    units(day) = make_unit("days since 2015-01-01")
    hour = set_units(0:23, h) # hour of day
    dims = st_dimensions(origin = from, destination = to, mode = mode, day = day, hour = hour)
    (n = dim(dims))
    ##      origin destination        mode         day        hour 
    ##         100         100           3         100          24
    traffic = array(rpois(prod(n), 10), dim = n) # simulated traffic counts
    (st = st_stars(list(traffic = traffic),  dimensions = dims))
    ## stars object with 5 dimensions and 1 attribute
    ## attribute(s), of first 1e+05 cells:
    ##     traffic  
    ##  Min.   : 0  
    ##  1st Qu.: 8  
    ##  Median :10  
    ##  Mean   :10  
    ##  3rd Qu.:12  
    ##  Max.   :25  
    ## dimension(s):
    ##             from  to                    offset                     delta
    ## origin         1 100                        NA                        NA
    ## destination    1 100                        NA                        NA
    ## mode           1   3                        NA                        NA

    ##                                          refsys point
    ## origin      +proj=longlat +datum=NAD27 +no_defs    NA
    ## destination +proj=longlat +datum=NAD27 +no_defs    NA
    ## mode                                         NA    NA
    ## day                                          NA    NA
    ## hour                                         NA    NA
    ##                                                                          values
    ## origin      MULTIPOLYGON (((-81.4727554..., ..., MULTIPOLYGON (((-78.6557159...
    ## destination MULTIPOLYGON (((-81.4727554..., ..., MULTIPOLYGON (((-78.6557159...
    ## mode                                                             car, ..., foot
    ## day                                                                        NULL
    ## hour                                                                       NULL

This array has the feature geometries as dimensions for origin and
destination, so that we can directly plot every slice without additional
table joins. If we want to represent such an array as a `tbl_cube`, the
simple feature geometry dimensions get lost and are replaced by indexes:

    st %>% as.tbl_cube 
    ## Source: local array [72,000,000 x 5]
    ## D: origin [int, 100]
    ## D: destination [int, 100]
    ## D: mode [chr, 3]
    ## D: day [units, 100]
    ## D: hour [units, 24]
    ## M: traffic [int]

The following demonstrates how `dplyr` can filter bike travel, and
compute mean bike traffic by hour of day:

    b <- st %>% as.tbl_cube %>%
      filter(mode == "bike") %>%
      group_by(hour) %>%
      summarise(traffic = mean(traffic)) %>%
      as.data.frame()
    require(ggforce)
    ## Loading required package: ggforce
    ggplot() +  
      geom_line(data=b, aes(x=hour, y=traffic))

Raster layers and bricks
------------------------

As a proof of concept, we can convert stars objects to and from raster
layers (2D) or raster bricks (3D), e.g.

    z.raster = as(z, "Raster")
    z2 = st_as_stars(z.raster)
    all.equal(z, z2, check.attributes = FALSE)
    ## [1] TRUE

(differences concern variable names, units, and dimension names)

Next steps
----------

The next steps in the stars project include:

-   we need to learn whether this data structure fits the needs, and is
    "fit" for the harder steps, involving scalability and remote
    computing
-   develop scalable versions, where `stars` objects proxy large arrays,
    locally, or on a remote server
-   implement subset, crop, apply methods in a more generic way than
    `filter` and `summarize` now do
-   create examples where we run a time-series model over each pixel
-   write easy plot methods
-   develop interactions with `mapview`

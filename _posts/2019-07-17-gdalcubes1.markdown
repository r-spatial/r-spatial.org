The problem
-----------

Scientists working with collections and time series of satellite imagery
quickly run into some of the following problems:

-   Images from different areas of the world have different spatial
    reference systems (e.g., UTM zones).
-   The pixel size of a single image sometimes differs among its
    spectral bands / variables.
-   Spatially adjacent image tiles often overlap.
-   Time series of images are often irregular when the area of interest
    covers spatial areas larger than the extent of a single image.
-   Images from different data products or different satellites are
    distributed in diverse data formats and structures.

[GDAL](https://gdal.org) and the [rgdal R
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rgdal) *can* solve most of
these difficulties by reading all relevant data formats and implementing
*image warping* to reproject, rescale, resample, and crop images.
However, GDAL does not know about *image time series* and hence there is
a lot of manual work needed before data scientists can actually work
with these data. Instead of *collections of images*, data users in many
cases desire a regular data structure such as a four-dimensional
[*raster data cube*](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) with dimensions
`x`, `y`, `time`, and `band`.

In R, there is currently no implementation to build regular data cubes
from image collections. The [`stars`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stars) provides a generic
implementation for processing raster and vector data cubes with an
arbitrary number of dimensions, but assumes that the data are already
organized as an array.

Introduction and overview of gdalcubes
--------------------------------------

This blog post introduces the `gdalcubes` R package, aiming at making
the work with collections and time series of satellite imagery easier
and more interactive.

The core features of the package are:

-   build *regular dense data cubes* from large satellite image
    collections based on a user-defined *data cube view* (spatiotemporal
    extent, resolution, and map projection of the cube)
-   apply and chaining operations on data cubes
-   allow for the execution of user-defined functions on data cubes
-   export data cubes as netCDF files, making it easy to process
    further, e.g., with
    [`stars`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stars) or
    [`raster`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=raster).

Technically, the R package is a relatively lightweight wrapper around
the [gdalcubes C++ library](https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes). The
library strongly builds on [GDAL](https://gdal.org),
[netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (the full list of C++
libraries used by gdalcubes is found
[here](https://appelmar.github.io/gdalcubes/credits.html)).

This blog post focuses on how to use the R package gdalcubes, more
details about the underlying ideas can be found in our recent open
access paper in the datacube special issue of [the DATA
journal](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/4/3/92).

Installation
------------

The package can be installed directly from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gdalcubes):

    install.packages("gdalcubes")

Some features and functions used in this blog post are still in the
development version (which will be submitted to CRAN as version 0.2.0),
which currently needs a source install:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_git("https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes_R", ref="dev", args="--recursive")

If this fails with error messages like "no rule to make target ...",
please read [here](https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes_R/issues/7).

Demo dataset
------------

We use a collection of 180 [Landsat
8](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8) surface reflectance images,
covering a small part of the Brazilian Amazon forest. If you would like
to work with the dataset on your own (and maybe reproduce some parts of
this blog post), you have two options:

**Option A:** Download the dataset with full resolution (30 meter pixel
size) [here](https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/s/SmiqWcCCeFSwfuY/download)
(67 gigabytes compressed; 190 gigabytes unzipped)

**Option B:** Download a *downsampled* version of the dataset that
contains all images at a coarse spatial resolution (300 meter pixel
size) [here](https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/s/e5yUZmYGX0bo4u9/download)
(740 megabytes compressed; 2 gigabytes unzipped)

Except for the spatial resolution of the images, the datasets are
identical, meaning that all code samples work for both options but
result images may look blurred when using option B. Here is the code to
download and unzip the dataset to your current working directory (which
might take some time):

    # Option A
    #download.file("https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/s/SmiqWcCCeFSwfuY/download", destfile = "L8_Amazon.zip")

    # Option B
    if (!file.exists("L8_Amazon.zip")) {
      download.file("https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/s/e5yUZmYGX0bo4u9/download", destfile = "L8_Amazon.zip")

      unzip("L8_Amazon.zip", exdir = "L8_Amazon")
    }

Creating image collections
--------------------------

After extraction of the zip archive, we get one directory per image,
where each image contains 10 GeoTIFF files representing the spectral
bands and additional per-pixel quality information. As a first step, we
must scan all available images once, extract some metadata (e.g.
acquisition date/time and spatial extents of images and how the files
relate to bands), and store this information in a simple *image
collection* index file. This file does not store any pixel values but
only metadata and references to where images can be found.

First, we simply need to find available GeoTIFF files in all
subdirectories of our demo dataset:

    files = list.files("L8_Amazon", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".tif")
    length(files)

    ## [1] 1800

    head(files)

    ## [1] "L8_Amazon/LC082260632014071901T1-SC20190715045926/LC08_L1TP_226063_20140719_20170421_01_T1_pixel_qa.tif"  
    ## [2] "L8_Amazon/LC082260632014071901T1-SC20190715045926/LC08_L1TP_226063_20140719_20170421_01_T1_radsat_qa.tif" 
    ## [3] "L8_Amazon/LC082260632014071901T1-SC20190715045926/LC08_L1TP_226063_20140719_20170421_01_T1_sr_aerosol.tif"
    ## [4] "L8_Amazon/LC082260632014071901T1-SC20190715045926/LC08_L1TP_226063_20140719_20170421_01_T1_sr_band1.tif"  
    ## [5] "L8_Amazon/LC082260632014071901T1-SC20190715045926/LC08_L1TP_226063_20140719_20170421_01_T1_sr_band2.tif"  
    ## [6] "L8_Amazon/LC082260632014071901T1-SC20190715045926/LC08_L1TP_226063_20140719_20170421_01_T1_sr_band3.tif"

To understand the structure of particular data products, the package
comes with a set of predefined rules (called *collection formats*) that
define how required metadata can be derived from the data. These include
formats for some Sentinel-2, MODIS, and Landsat products. We can list
all available formats with:

The "L8\_SR" format is what we need for our demo dataset. Next, we must
tell gdalcubes to scan the files and build an image collection. Below,
we create an image collection from the set of GeoTIFF files, using the
"L8\_SR" collection format and store the resulting image collection
under "L8.db".

    L8.col = create_image_collection(files, "L8_SR", "L8.db")

Internally, the output file is a simple SQLite database. Please notice
that our collection does not contain data for all possible bands (see
`image_count` column). Depending on particular data download requests,
Landsat 8 surface reflectance data may come e.g. with some
post-processed bands (like vegetation indexes) that can be used if
available.

Creating and processing data cubes
----------------------------------

To create a raster data cube, we need (i) an image collection and (ii) a
*data cube view*, defining *how* we look at the data, i.e., at which
spatiotemporal resolution, window, and spatial reference system. For a
quick look at the data, we define a cube view with 1km x 1km pixel size,
yearly temporal resolution, covering the full spatiotemporal extent of
the image collection, and using the web mercator spatial reference
system.

    v.overview = cube_view(extent=L8.col, dt="P1Y", dx=1000, dy=1000, srs="EPSG:3857", 
                           aggregation = "median", resampling = "bilinear")
    raster_cube(L8.col, v.overview)

As specified in our data cube view, the time dimension of the resulting
data cube only has 7 values, representing years from 2013 to 2019. The
aggregation parameter in the data cube view defines how values from
multiple images in the same year shall be combined. In contrast, the
selected resampling algorithm is applied when reprojecting and rescaling
individual images.

If we are interested in a smaller area at higher temporal resolution, we
simply need to define a data cube view with different parameters,
including a specific spatiotemporal extent by passing a list as extent
argument to `cube_view`. Below, we define a data cube view for a 100km x
100km area with 50m pixel size at monthly temporal resolution.

    v.subarea = cube_view(extent=list(left=-6320000, right=-6220000, bottom=-600000, top=-500000, 
                          t0="2014-01-01", t1="2018-12-31"), dt="P1M", dx=50, dy=50, srs="EPSG:3857", 
                          aggregation = "median", resampling = "bilinear")

    raster_cube(L8.col, v.subarea)

The `raster_cube` function always returns a proxy object, meaning that
neither any expensive computations nor any data reads from disk are
started. Instead, gdalcubes delays the execution until the data is
really needed when users call `plot()`, or `write_ncdf()`. However, the
result of our call to `raster_cube` can be passed to data cube
operators. For example, the code below drops all bands except the
visible RGB bands and, again, returns a proxy object.

    L8.cube.rgb = select_bands(raster_cube(L8.col, v.overview), c("B02","B03","B04")) 
    L8.cube.rgb 

    ## A GDAL data cube proxy object
    ## Dimensions:
    ##   name        low       high size chunk_size
    ## 1    t     2013.0     2019.0    7         16
    ## 2    y  -764014.4  -205014.4  559        256
    ## 3    x -6582280.1 -5799280.1  783        256
    ## 
    ## Bands:
    ##   name    type offset scale nodata unit
    ## 1  B02 float64      0     1    NaN     
    ## 2  B03 float64      0     1    NaN     
    ## 3  B04 float64      0     1    NaN

Calling `plot()` will eventually start computationn, and hence might
take some time:

    system.time(plot(L8.cube.rgb, rgb=3:1, zlim=c(0,1200)))

Chaining data cube operations
-----------------------------

For the remaining examples, we use multiple threads to process data
cubes by setting:

    gdalcubes_options(threads=4)

We can chain many of the provided data cube operators (e.g., using the
pipe `%>%`). The following code will derive the median values of the RGB
bands over time, producing a single RGB overview image for our selected
subarea.

    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(magrittr)) # use the pipe
    raster_cube(L8.col, v.subarea) %>%
      select_bands(c("B02","B03","B04")) %>%
      reduce_time("median(B02)", "median(B03)", "median(B04)") %>%
      plot(rgb=3:1, zlim=c(0,1200))

![](/images/figure-markdown_mmd/gdalcubes1-1.png)

Implemented data cube operators include:

-   `apply_pixel` apply one or more arithmetic expressions on individual
    data cube pixels, e.g., to derive vegetation indexes.
-   `reduce_time` apply on or more reducers over pixel time series.
-   `reduce_time` apply on or more reducers over spatial slices.
-   `select_bands` subset available bands.
-   `window_time` apply an aggregation function or convolution kernel
    over moving time series windows.
-   `join_bands` combines the bands of two indentically shaped data
    cubes.
-   `filter_pixel` filter pixels by a logical expression on band values,
    e.g., select all pixels with NDVI larger than 0.
-   `write_ncdf` export a data cube as a netCDF file.

In a second example, we compute the normalied difference vegetation
index (NDVI) with `apply_pixel` and derive its maximum values over time:

    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(viridis)) # use colors from viridis package

    raster_cube(L8.col, v.subarea) %>%
      select_bands(c("B04","B05")) %>%
      apply_pixel(c("(B05-B04)/(B05+B04)"), names="NDVI") %>%
      reduce_time("max(NDVI)") %>%
      plot(zlim=c(-0.2,1), col=viridis, key.pos=1)

![](/images/figure-markdown_mmd/gdalcubes2-1.png)

User-defined functions
----------------------

Previous examples used character expressions to define reducer and
arithmetic functions. Operations like `apply_pixel` and `filter_pixel`
take character arguments to define the expressions. The reason for this
is that expressions are translated to C++ functions and all computations
then are purely C++. However, to give users more flexibility and allow
the definition of user-defined functions, `reduce_time` and
`apply_pixel` also allow to pass arbitrary R functions as an argument.
In the example below, we derive the 0.25, and 0.75 quantiles over NDVI
time series. There is of course no limitation what the provided reducer
function does and it is thus possible to use functions from other
packages.

    v.16d = cube_view(view=v.overview, dt="P16D")
    raster_cube(L8.col, v.16d) %>%
      select_bands(c("B04", "B05")) %>%
      apply_pixel(c("(B05-B04)/(B05+B04)"), names="NDVI") %>%
      reduce_time(names = c("q1","q3"), FUN = function(x) {
        quantile(x["NDVI",], probs = c(0.25, 0.75), na.rm = TRUE)
      }) %>%
      plot(col=viridis, zlim=c(-0.2,1), key.pos=1)

![](/images/figure-markdown_mmd/gdalcubes3-1.png)

However, there are some things, users need to keep in mind when working
with user-defined functions:

1.  Users should provide names of the output bands and make sure that
    the function always return the same number of elements.
2.  When executed, the function runs in a new R session, meaning that it
    cannot access variables in the current worskspace and packages must
    be loaded within the function if needed.
3.  Ideally, users should carefully check for errors. A frequent cause
    for errors is the presence of NA values, which are abundant in
    raster data cubes from irregular image collections.
4.  In the current version, only `apply_pixel` and `reduce_time` allow
    for passing user-defined functions.

Interfacing with stars
----------------------

The `stars` package is much more generic and supports higher dimensional
arrays and hence supports e.g. data from climate model output. It also
does not assume data to be orthorectified, i.e. it works also with
curvilinear grids and hence supports data as from Sentinel-5P. In
contrast, gdalcubes concentrates on multispectral image time series (4d)
only.

gdalcubes currently comes with a simple `as_stars()` function, writing a
data cube as a (temporary) netCDF file, which is then opened by
`read_stars`. The stars object holds bands as attributes. If needed
(e.g. for ggplot below), `st_redimension` converts attributes to a new
dimension.

    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stars))

    x = raster_cube(L8.col, v.overview) %>%
      select_bands(c("B02","B03","B04")) %>%
      as_stars()
    x

Future work
-----------

There are many things, which we didn't cover in this blog post like
applying masks during the construction of data cubes. More importantly,
a question we are very much interested in at the moment is how far we
can go with gdalcubes and stars in cloud computing envrionments, where
huge image collections such as the full Sentinel-2 archive are already
stored. This will be the topic of another blog post.

We also have a lot of ideas for future developments but no real
schedule. If you would like to contribute, get involved, or if you have
further ideas, please get in touch! Development and discussion takes
place on GitHub ([R package on
GitHub](https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes_R), [C++ library on
GitHub](https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes) ).

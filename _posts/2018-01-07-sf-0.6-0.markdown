Version 0.6-0 of the sf package (an R package for handling vector
geometries in R) has been released to CRAN. It contains several
innovations, summarized in the
[NEWS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/news.html) file. This
blog post will illustrate some of these further.

Ring directions
---------------

Consider the following two polygons:

    library(sf)

    ## Loading required package: methods

    ## Linking to GEOS 3.5.1, GDAL 2.1.2, proj.4 4.9.3

    p1 = rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(1,1), c(0,1), c(0,0))
    p2 = 0.5 * p1 + 0.25
    (pol1 = st_polygon(list(p1, p2)))

    ## POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 1, 0 0), (0.25 0.25, 0.75 0.25, 0.75 0.75, 0.25 0.75, 0.25 0.25))

    (pol2 = st_polygon(list(p1, p2[5:1,])))

    ## POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 1, 0 0), (0.25 0.25, 0.25 0.75, 0.75 0.75, 0.75 0.25, 0.25 0.25))

    opar = par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = rep(0, 4))
    plot(pol1, col = grey(.8), rule = "winding")
    plot(pol2, col = grey(.8), rule = "winding")

Although the simple feature standard describes that all secondary rings
indicate holes, it also specifies that outer rings should be counter
clockwise and inner rings (holes) clockwise. It doesn't specify that
polygons for which the hole has the same ring direction as the outer
ring are invalid - and they aren't. But how should software deal with
them? In prior `sf` versions, `plot` (and ggplot) would take the
`winding` rule, requiring holes to have the opposite direction as outer
rings. This has been changed into `evenodd` as default, which plots both
cases with holes:

    library(sf)
    p1 = rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(1,1), c(0,1), c(0,0))
    p2 = 0.5 * p1 + 0.25
    (pol1 = st_polygon(list(p1, p2)))

    ## POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 1, 0 0), (0.25 0.25, 0.75 0.25, 0.75 0.75, 0.25 0.75, 0.25 0.25))

    (pol2 = st_polygon(list(p1, p2[5:1,])))

    ## POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 1, 0 0), (0.25 0.25, 0.25 0.75, 0.75 0.75, 0.75 0.25, 0.25 0.25))

    opar = par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = rep(0, 4))
    plot(pol1, col = grey(.8)) # rule = "evenodd"
    plot(pol2, col = grey(.8)) # rule = "evenodd"

![](/images/pol2-1.png)

In addition, `st_sfc` and `st_read` gained a parameter `check_ring_dir`,
by default `FALSE`, which when `TRUE` will check every ring and revert
them to counter clockwise for outer, and clockwise for inner (hole)
rings. By default this is `FALSE` because it is an expensive operation
for large datasets.

Higher-order geometry differences
---------------------------------

This was reported [here](http://r-spatial.org/r/2017/12/21/geoms.html);
two nice graphs are available from `?st_difference`

    set.seed(131)
    m = rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(1,1), c(0,1), c(0,0))
    p = st_polygon(list(m))
    n = 100
    l = vector("list", n)
    for (i in 1:n)
        l[[i]] = p + 10 * runif(2)
    s = st_sfc(l)
    d = st_difference(s)   # sequential differences: s1, s2-s1, s3-s2-s1, ...
    i = st_intersection(s) # all intersections
    plot(s, col = sf.colors(categorical = TRUE, alpha = .5))
    title("overlapping squares")

    par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(0,0,2.4,0))
    plot(d, col = sf.colors(categorical = TRUE, alpha = .5))
    title("non-overlapping differences")
    plot(i, col = sf.colors(categorical = TRUE, alpha = .5))
    title("non-overlapping intersections")

Spherical geometry
------------------

All geometric operations (area, length, intersects, intersection, union
etc) provided by the GEOS library assume two-dimensional coordinates. If
your data have geographic (longitude-latitude) coordinates, this is may
be quite OK when your area is small and close to the equator, otherwise
it is not. One way out is to project the data using a suitable
projection, the other is to use spherical geometry: algorithms that
compute *on the sphere* (or, more precisely, on the
[*spheroid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid). This has a number
of advantages:

-   it is easy, you have no-worries about which projection to choose
-   it is always correct

however, it comes at some computational cost.

Spherical geometry functions were formerly taken from R package
`geosphere`; with the new `sf` they use package
[lwgeom](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lwgeom/index.html),
which interfaces liblwgeom, the library that PostGIS also uses (and the
development of which was funded by
[palantir](https://www.directionsmag.com/article/1638)).

Liblwgeom functions `st_make_valid`, `st_geohash`, `st_split`, which were
formerly in `sf` have now been moved to `lwgeom`. Other functions in
`lwgeom` enable the following functions to work with geographic
coordinates: `st_length`, `st_area` `st_distance`,
`st_is_within_distance`, `st_segmentize`.

Where `geosphere` could only compute distances between points,
`st_distance` now computes distances between arbitrary simple feature
geometries. `st_distance` is clearly slower when computed on a spheroid
than when computed on the sphere. For point data, faster results are
obtained when we assume the Earth is a sphere:

    n = 2000
    df = data.frame(x = runif(n), y = runif(n))
    pts = st_as_sf(df, coords = c("x", "y"))
    system.time(x0 <- st_distance(pts))

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   3.456   0.008   3.479

    st_crs(pts) = 4326 # spheroid
    system.time(x1 <- st_distance(pts))

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   5.564   0.016   5.594

    st_crs(pts) = "+proj=longlat +ellps=sphere" # sphere

    ## Warning: st_crs<- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform
    ## for that

    system.time(x2 <- st_distance(pts))

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   1.220   0.024   1.246

    system.time(x3 <- dist(as.matrix(df)))

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   0.012   0.000   0.010

Hausdorff and Frechet distance
------------------------------

For two-dimensional (flat) geometries, `st_distance` now has the option
of computing [Hausdorff
distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance), and (if
`sf` was linked to GEOS 3.7.0) [Frechet
distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance).

snap!
-----

For two-dimensional (flat) geometries, `st_snap` is now available; we
refer to the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Snap.html)
documentation for examples what it does.

join to largest matching feature

polygon geometries have zero length
-----------------------------------

Function `st_length` now returns zero for non-linear geometries
*including polygons*. For length of polygon rings, `st_cast` to
`MULTILINESTRING` first.

printing coordinates now honors `digits` setting
------------------------------------------------

Printing of geometries, as well as `st_as_text` now use the default
digits of R:

    st_point(c(1/3, 1/6))

    ## POINT (0.3333333 0.1666667)

    options(digits = 3)
    st_point(c(1/3, 1/6))

    ## POINT (0.333 0.167)

    st_as_text(st_point(c(1/3, 1/6)), digits = 16)

    ## [1] "POINT (0.3333333333333333 0.1666666666666667)"

Before `sf` 0.6, `as.character` was used, which used around 16 digits.
